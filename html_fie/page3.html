        <p id="inside-3">In this profound perspective, it is believed that there are just two entities in the entire world: you and the divine presence of Lord Shiva. Every living being you encounter is seen as a sacred messenger sent by Lord Shiva, and every life situation you face is considered an exam orchestrated by the divine, designed to help you unravel life's mysteries and elevate your soul.</p>
